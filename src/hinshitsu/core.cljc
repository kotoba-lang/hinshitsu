  checks. Generalizes the ad-hoc `SdkCheckStatus` / `*CheckReport` /
  `EvidenceCheckReport` shapes kotoba-shell's Rust implementation hand-rolls
  per check into one reusable, host-neutral EDN schema, so any kotoba tool
  (kotoba-shell, kotoba-cli, hinshitsu.mokushi, or a future check) can produce
  and consume the same evidence shape instead of inventing its own.

  Pure data + pure functions. No filesystem, no process, no network — those
